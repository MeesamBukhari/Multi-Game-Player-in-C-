# Multi-Game-Player-in-CPP
Partnering with my mate, I spearheaded the development of a dynamic CLI-based Game Player, a standout project born from our programming fundamentals coursework. This versatile C++ application showcased three classic games:

1. TicTacToe: Engage in strategic battles on a 3x3 grid.
2. RockPaperScissors: Enter 'R' for Rock, 'P' for Paper, or 'S' for Scissors in the ultimate hand gesture showdown, a highlight of our semester project.
3. GuessTheNumber: Challenge a friend to guess the secret number within a defined range.

Our collaboration not only demonstrated our proficiency in C++ programming but also underscored our teamwork, problem-solving abilities, and project management skills. From brainstorming sessions to debugging, every phase of development was meticulously executed to deliver a seamless and immersive gaming experience.
